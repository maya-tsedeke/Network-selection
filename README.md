The problem solved by JavaScript program 
 In this program I tried to address all questions , The code structure contains 5 JS files
 1. calculate_distance.js: Here used to calculate the distance of the device from the network station. The method I used to calculate linear distance equestions
  Linear Distance means the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of a structure or object to the high speed or network line to the device from station.

 2. calculate_speed.js
 Speed calculation formula already defined in the problems: What is the speed of network From Current device location to pointed station location?
            Defined formula is speed = (reach - device's distance from network station)^2
            in this file I wrot the code to calculate the speed of the connection from network station to the node or devices. To calculate this I used builtin math library which is called math.pow() function
            Also we can use without builtin function like below
            
            var result = (reach-distance)*(reach-distance);
            return res;

 3. define_device_loc.js
             In this file I defined and initialized the value of xy points for device current location
 4. define_station.js
              In this file I Defined and initialized the value of current point of the station location
 5. main.js
 Any programmer can easily modify in main.js programm because all code segmments are written supparatly 
 The output generated in this js file.

 This can be easily maintain and modified by any programmers.
